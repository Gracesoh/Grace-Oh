## Overview 
I am working as a research intern at Professor Tatlock's program languages and software engineering lab. Specifically, I'm working on the Sidewinder project which is focusing on creating improved PSVs that can help programmers better understand, visualize, and learn what their code is doing. My posts are simply to share my experiences, lessons, and takeaways from this internship :)
